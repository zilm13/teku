### Breaking Changes

### Additions and Improvements
 - Scheduled the Glamsterdam (Gloas) upgrade on Sepolia for epoch `353024` (October 6, 2026 13:53:36 UTC).
 - Updated aircompressor to 3.8 and made it the only Snappy implementation for gossip and RPC (removed snappy-xerial dependency)
 - `GET /eth/v1/events` now responds with `400` when a requested topic is not recognised, instead of opening a stream which never delivers any events.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed status, event, validator and database log messages being written twice when `--log-destination` is set to `CONSOLE` or `FILE`.
 - Fixed an out of memory error when a sync stopped while the chain head was still far behind. The node no longer reports itself as in sync in that case.
 - Fixed cases where Teku kept running, or hung while shutting down, after an out of memory error instead of exiting. It can now exit with code 3 as well as the usual code 1; both mean the node can be restarted.
 - `POST /eth/v1/validator/{pubkey}/graffiti` now responds with `202` instead of `204` on success, as required by the keymanager API spec.
 - A block production request that fails no longer keeps its preparation for the slot, so a retry within the same slot starts from a fresh preparation.
